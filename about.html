      <p class="about text">
        I’ve always wanted to make games — and one day I just decided to go for
        it. Now I’m studying game development at university and diving into
        everything from programming to design, learning the tools and figuring
        it out as I go.
      </p>
      <p class="about text">
        I’m into competitive shooters, movement-based games, roguelites, and
        anything with a solid story. I like games that feel sharp, fast, or
        meaningful — ideally all three. I’m usually pretty quiet and reserved,
        but with the right people, I open up. I love experimenting and seeing
        what sticks.
      </p>
      <p class="about text">
        Right now, I’m focused on learning and building. Long term, I see myself
        in indie dev — unless a studio actually earns my respect and gives me
        something real to be a part of.
