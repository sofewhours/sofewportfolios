                    <p> Hey! I'm a Game Design and Production student heading into my second year, with a strong focus on <strong>game programming</strong>. I primarily work in <strong>C#</strong> but have been experimenting with <strong>Lua</strong>, and I’m currently exploring <strong>full-stack web development</strong> as I build out this website. I enjoy working on interactive systems, game mechanics, and learning how things work under the hood — whether it's in a game engine or the browser.

                <p>
                    I want to make games that are unapologetic in nature — raw, personal, and crafted with intention. Games that aren't afraid to challenge players or break from trend. But above all, games that people can truly enjoy.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My goal is to bring players back to what gaming used to be: passionate, creative, and player-first. Back when games were made by gamers, not engineered by marketing teams or driven by endless monetization loops.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In a world drowning in AAA corporate sludge and AI-generated noise, I want to carve out something real. I want to help people reconnect with the magic of those years gone — when picking up a game meant stepping into someone's vision, not a product roadmap.
